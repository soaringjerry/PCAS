# PCAS (Personal Central AI System)

**PCAS is an open-source, local-first, intelligent decision-making engine designed to power a new generation of personal AI operating systems.**

It serves as the core technical heart of the **DreamHub Ecosystem**, a broader vision for a user-centric AI future built on the principle of "Absolute Data Sovereignty, Flexible Compute Scheduling."

---

## üìñ What is PCAS?

PCAS is not a user-facing application. It is a **deployable software engine** that you run in your private environment (e.g., your PC or home server). Its sole purpose is to act as a secure and intelligent "decision-making center" for your digital life.

It connects to various applications and services (we call them D-Apps) through an **Intelligent Event Bus**, allowing you to create powerful, automated workflows while ensuring your data never leaves your control.

> To delve deeper into the philosophy and technicals, please read the **[PCAS Whitepaper](docs/architecture/whitepaper.md)** and the **[PCAS Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/pcas-overview.md)**.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Absolute Data Sovereignty:** PCAS and your data run in your private environment. You have full control. Period.
*   **üéõÔ∏è Flexible Compute Modes:** Through a built-in "Policy Engine," you decide how AI tasks are processed:
    *   **Local Mode:** Maximum privacy with local AI models.
    *   **Hybrid Mode:** The perfect balance of privacy and performance.
    *   **Cloud Mode:** Maximum power using cloud AI APIs.
*   **ü§ñ Intelligent Decision-Making:** PCAS acts as your "Personal Decision Center," understanding your intent and coordinating D-Apps to get things done.
*   **üß© Open D-App Ecosystem:** The event bus architecture allows any service to be integrated as a D-App.
*   **üöÄ Foundation for Personal AI:** PCAS is designed to be a "Data Crucible," helping you build a private dataset to fine-tune your own personal AI models.
*   **üåê Open Standard & Community:** We aim for PCAS to become an open standard for a new pattern of personal AI.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

PCAS is the central hub in a mesh-like, event-driven network of D-Apps.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get PCAS up and running in minutes with our modern development workflow.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- An OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 integration)

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soaringjerry/pcas.git
cd pcas
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
# Required: Your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# Optional: Customize ports if needed
PCAS_PORT=50051
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

### 3. Start Everything

Use our all-in-one command:
```bash
make dev-up
```

This will:
- Start PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Initialize the database schema
- Build the PCAS binaries
- Start the PCAS server with your configuration

### 4. Try It Out

**Create a memory with user identity:**
```bash
./bin/pcasctl emit --type pcas.memory.create.v1 \
  --user-id alice \
  --subject "My favorite programming language is Go"
```

**Ask a question (with RAG-enhanced response):**
```bash
./bin/pcasctl emit --type pcas.user.prompt.v1 \
  --user-id alice \
  --data '{"prompt": "What is my favorite programming language?"}'
```

**Search memories semantically:**
```bash
./bin/pcasctl search "programming preferences"
```

### 5. Explore Advanced Examples

Check out our Multi-AI Chatbot example to see PCAS's multi-identity capabilities in action:
```bash
cd examples/multi-ai-chatbot
go run main.go --user-id alice
```

### üõë Stopping PCAS

```bash
make dev-down
```

This cleanly shuts down all services and preserves your data.
