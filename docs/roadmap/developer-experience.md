# Developer Experience Roadmap

**Date**: 2025-07-06

**Status**: Proposed

## 1. Vision

To make building d-Apps for the DreamHub ecosystem a delightful, productive, and empowering experience. We aim to provide a world-class toolchain, comprehensive documentation, and a supportive community that lowers the barrier to entry and accelerates innovation.

## 2. Key Initiatives (Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Foundational Tooling (Short-Term)

*   **SDKs for Core Languages**:
    *   Provide feature-complete, well-documented SDKs for Go and Python.
    *   Include rich examples for every major feature.
*   **Standard D-App Template**:
    *   Create a "Hello World" d-App template repository.
    *   The template must include a pre-configured `dapp.yaml`, best practices for event handling, and a simple build process.
*   **CLI Enhancements**:
    *   Improve `pcasctl` with better output formatting and more powerful query capabilities.

### Phase 2: Community & Marketplace (Mid-Term)

*   **Developer Portal**:
    *   Launch a dedicated developer portal (`developer.dreamhub.com`).
    *   This portal will host all documentation, tutorials, SDKs, and community forums.
*   **D-App Marketplace**:
    *   Design and launch a simple d-App marketplace.
    *   Allows developers to publish, share, and discover d-Apps.
    *   Includes a verification process for security and quality.

### Phase 3: Advanced Tooling (Long-Term)

*   **Local Debugging & Simulation**:
    *   Develop a local "PCAS Simulator" that allows developers to test their d-Apps without running the full PCAS stack.
*   **Event Flow Visualizer**:
    *   Build a tool that can connect to a running PCAS instance and visualize the event flow in real-time, making debugging choreography-based systems intuitive.

This document will serve as the high-level guide for all future work related to improving the developer experience in the DreamHub ecosystem.
